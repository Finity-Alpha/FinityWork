# Finity Work

Trying to create a digital AI worker. Someone who can work independently towards
helping work get done. 
Things like, writing docs, plans, content on Notion.
Making code pull requests.
Drawing diagrams on Miro. 
Researching on things and writing reports.

Being proactive, suggesting what should be done next.
Gives updates to people, reviewing other people's work etc.

What roles could it pull off if we build one today? 
Sales and Marketing might be easier, secretary or VA would also work, 
software developer would be difficult, product manager might be doable. 


What would the software architecture look like? How would we use LLMs for this?
Would the context length be enough? Is RAG the answer? Fine-tuning? RL?
